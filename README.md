Chicago is where all started more than 10 years ago when I first moved to the states. Now I'm back for another chapter of my life. I wanted to commemorate my move to Chicago and the first time living in the hustle and bustle of the big city by building something reminiscent of what intrigued me in financial markets for the first time. I was still in high school, and a friend of my mentioned shadowing an acquaintance for a day in Chicago Board of Trade. While financial markets have mostly gone digital, I can't help romanticizing the era of open outcry. There is something primal about what happened in a pit that captures human's desire to win. I always thought it was interesting way to establish order through madnesss. What an oxymoron.
